    <h1>Relevant Projects</h1>
    
    <section class="projects">
        <p><b>ICT4D KasaDaka Weather Prediction for Sub-Saharan Africa</b></p>

        <p>Managed an interdisciplinary team towards the development of a <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tB0jlxmyZQ">voice-based weather
        service</a> with automated geo-location for farmers in remote West
    Africa.</p>
        <p>Modelled the prototype around <i>Human Computer Interaction
            (HCI)</i> ideals for improved user functionality by using GPS
        based auto detection of the users location to provide rainfall and
        storm information with minimal user interactions.</p>
        <p>Development was done using <i>Django-Heroku</i> and <i>KasaDaka</i>
        Voice Service Development Kit (VSDK) within the context of limited
        technology and diverse cultural and socio-economic aspect in West
        Africa.</p>
        <p>The service is due to be tested in Ghana for further feedback and
        development as part of the ICT4D research programme at the Vrije
        Universiteit.</p>

        <p><b>3D Kadaster Urban Landscape of The Netherlands</b></p>

        <p>As part of a 3 person team, developed a 3D model of all the buildings in
        The Netherlands using 2TB point-cloud data and 18GB 2D building
        polygons.</p>
        <p>SurfSara's <i>Hadoop Cluster</i> and <i>LasPy</i> were used for data
        pre-processing. Pre-processing techniques achieved significant data
        reduction, from 2TB to 3MB and 18GB data to 1.5GB respectively.</p>
        <p>The 3D point cloud data was represented as octrees and masked and
        intersected with 2D building layouts.</p>
        <p><i>three.js</i> was used to generate meshes and render the <a
            href="https://event.cwi.nl/lsde/2018/results/group13/">buildings</a>.</p>
        <p>Project received recognition in the <a
            href="https://event.cwi.nl/lsde/2018/showcase_c1.shtml">Large Scale
            Data Engineering</a> Hall of Fame.</p>

        <p><b>OmniArt Sentiment Analysis and Visualisation</b></p>
        <p>Conducted sentiment analysis using <i>SentiStrength</i> and
        <i>Python</i> on the OmniArt dataset - a detailed collection of 1
        million artworks and their metadata.</p>
        <p>Remarks made on various artworks gathered from 17BCE until 2012 were
        represented as human sentiment values. The goal was to observe the
        relationship between human sentiments and art across different cultural
        time periods.</p>
        <p>Key findings noted association of the Pop Art era that displayed vivid
        colours with positive emotions while both the Renaissance and Baroque era
        were associated with neutral to negative emotions.</p>
        <p>Data processing challenges were identified due to quality of the artwork
        descriptions that were found to be very sparse in nature and often
        unrelated or inconsistently worded.</p>

        <p><b>CommonCrawl Knowledge Extraction Engine</b></p>
        <p>As part of a team, implemented a <i>knowledge extraction engine</i>
        to extract entities from the CommonCrawl dataset and linked them to
        Freebase.</p>
        <p>WARC files were streamed with <i>warcio</i> and pre-processing and
        text mining were performed on the <i>DAS4</i> cluster with
        <i>PySpark</i>.</p>
        <p>Additionally, a novel method for extracting relations between two
        entities was proposed for the <i>NLTK Python library</i>. PATTY was used to
        train a model that predicted the relation between two entities given some
        filler text with 42.5% accuracy.</p>

        <p><b>User Activity Prediction for Quantified Self</b></p>
        <p>As a part of a team, used the ActiTracker dataset to obtain user
        activity and predict and classify activity using personal and
        impersonal models.</p>
        <p>Achieved high accuracy of 96% with the personal model with
        <i>Python</i>.</p>
