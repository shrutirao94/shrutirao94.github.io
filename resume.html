    <h1>Summary</h1>

    <section class="summary">
    <p> I am a computer science researcher with skills in application of deep
    learning to inter-disciplinary problems. I especially work within the realm
    of designing tools and workflows around big data to ensure software best
    practices while highlighting domain problems in a new light.</p>

    <p>I recently conducted novel research with 3D deep learning for neutrino
    detection by representing data as point clouds. My methodology combined
    with my novel noise detection solutions demonstrated highly promising
    results and have set the path for 3D deep learning within particle
    physics. </p>

    <p> I am keen on working at the intersection of big data, 3D deep learning
    and ethical, accountable AI that considers HCI. </p>

    <h1>Publications</h1>

    <section class="publications">
        <p><b>ACM Multimedia Conference, Nice</b> <small>[16 October
            2019]</small></p> 
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1ZM6EQgEvU">ACE</a> is a
        data driven, web-based platform for exploring visual sentiment and
        emotion in artistic paintings over time. A visual artistic sentiment
        extraction model was trained using artworks from the OmniArt dataset to
        estimate overall sentiments dominating specific time periods. An
        intuitive interface and extensive control on resource utilisation is in
        line with principles of Human-Computer Interaction to parse and display
        individual colour pixels and provide the smoothest possible user
        experience.</p>

    <h1>Relevant Projects</h1>
    
    <section class="projects">
        <p><b>ICT4D KasaDaka Weather Prediction for Sub-Saharan Africa</b></p>

        <p>Managed an interdisciplinary team towards the development of a <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tB0jlxmyZQ">voice-based weather
        service</a> with automated geo-location for farmers in remote West
    Africa.</p>
        <p>Modelled the prototype around <i>Human Computer Interaction
            (HCI)</i> ideals for improved user functionality by using GPS
        based auto detection of the users location to provide rainfall and
        storm information with minimal user interactions.</p>
        <p>Development was done using <i>Django-Heroku</i> and <i>KasaDaka</i>
        Voice Service Development Kit (VSDK) within the context of limited
        technology and diverse cultural and socio-economic aspect in West
        Africa.</p>
        <p>The service is due to be tested in Ghana for further feedback and
        development as part of the ICT4D research programme at the Vrije
        Universiteit.</p>

        <p><b>3D Kadaster Urban Landscape of The Netherlands</b></p>

        <p>As part of a 3 person team, developed a 3D model of all the buildings in
        The Netherlands using 2TB point-cloud data and 18GB 2D building
        polygons.</p>
        <p>SurfSara's <i>Hadoop Cluster</i> and <i>LasPy</i> were used for data
        pre-processing. Pre-processing techniques achieved significant data
        reduction, from 2TB to 3MB and 18GB data to 1.5GB respectively.</p>
        <p>The 3D point cloud data was represented as octrees and masked and
        intersected with 2D building layouts.</p>
        <p><i>three.js</i> was used to generate meshes and render the <a
            href="https://event.cwi.nl/lsde/2018/results/group13/">buildings</a>.</p>
        <p>Project received recognition in the <a
