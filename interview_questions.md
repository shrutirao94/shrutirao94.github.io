# PhD Interview Questions

**Position:** Trustworthy AI

## Self Reflection

### Tell Us About Yourself

I completed my undergraduate in Mathematical Economics in Canada. As part of
the co-op program I also gained around 2 years of work experience, notably at
Microsoft Canada where I served as an analyst for the finance and revenue team.
This allowed me exposure to work within large, inter-disciplinary teams...  For
my final honours project, I undertook a 6 month long project into modeling the
spillover effects of restautant businesses into neighbourhood quality. The goal
was to allow policy makers to target restaurant businesses when trying to
improve neighbourhoods and attarct positive growth. This is the first instance
where I noticed flaws in creating algorithms in a simulated environment versus
testing with real world data. My work with simulated economics data showed that
improving restaurant quality positively impacted neighbourhood quality.
However, when I assessed my model on real world dataset, I noticed a negative
if not null relationship. This is the first instance where I noticed that AI
was not a perfect solution and infact a blackbox. This experience motivated me
to further understand such algorithms and obtain more technical skills. That is
why I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science. 

My masters gave me several opportunities to develop technical skills in both SE
and AI while working within inter-disciplinary environments. 

1. For example we worked on a large-scale data engineering project where we
   reconstructed all the buildings in the Netherlands by combining 18TB of
   point cloud data with 8 GB of 2D building polygons. 

2. I conducted sentiment anaysis using state-of-the-art algorithm to obtain
   human sentiments from written comments on paintings. Here, I noticed
   shortcomings or dissonance between what the alorithm was supposed to do and
   what it actually derived from real world data. So in order to improve the
   system I had to tap into colour theory and human psychology to try and
   create my own framework to lead the model better. We used these results to
   develop an interactive analysis tool and this work got published in the
   ACMMM conference in 2019.
3. I also had the opportunity to work on an ICT4D project to aid sub-saharan
   farmers learn about weather conditions using a Voice-based application. Here
   we wished to improve our application by using an AI driven prediction
   system. Here our prototypes failed miserabley since all major speech-to-text
   systems assume global accents and did not account for regional accents or
   language. So it often misinterpreted the responses and provided inaccurate
   information.
4. For my thesis, I was determined to build deep learning tools for
   inter-disciplinary research. So I collaborated with Physicists from Nikhef,
   the Netherlands eScience Center and UVA and developed an end-to-end 3D deep
   learning pipeline to detect neutrinos amidst significant background noise.
   In order to avoid some of the pitfalls of trustworthyness in deep learning,
   I used physics knowledge to drive the project (in terms of training data,
   evaluation metrics and visual analysis of results). My work is the first of
   its kind and sets the way for 3D deep learning in Particle Physics. I also
   built a regression network to further obtain physics properties from the 3D
   pipeline.

Aside from the technical skills, I belive I gained skills relevant for research
in general. For example, I learnt to communicate technical information to
non-technical stakeholders through conducting a symposium for our OmniARt
project. I also served as project manager for the ICT4D course and communicated
with teams and officers in Ghana. For my thesis as well, I routinely shared and
discussed reults of my research with Physicists and other teams from Nikhef. 

Having completed my thesis, I realised that I was not satisfied with stopping
and I wished to learn more. Further, through my projects I belive I had found a
problem area to engage in - acknowledging and addressing the reliability of AI
in critical fields. Which is why I applied to this position.

### Why Do You Want To Do A PhD?

The AI driven projects that I engaged in all demonstrated critical flaws in the
way we interact with and understand such algorithms. In the OmniArt project I
attempted to setup my own framework to address the reliabilityy of the AI. But
if there had been a well establised framework in place, I may have done a
better job in terms of my approach, my consistancy and my understanding. I
imagine facing this type of situation in a critical field say the medical
domain or the finance sector. The stakes rise considerably when lives or
finance or economies are involved. More and more systems are adopting AI but
not many are questioning it. I belive that this is a critical problem that I
personally faced throughout my academic life and I wish to address it through
further research.

From a more personal perspective, at each stage of my education, I have not
been satisfied with what I have learnt and wished to continue learning. Having
completed my Masters, I feel the same way. Moreover, I am not satisfied with
my contributions to science and society and believe that I can do more. I
believe that a PhD can help me fulfil these aspirations. 


### Why Did You Apply for this PhD?
1. why the topic
2. why the group
3. past work they have done
4. university


I belive that this position will allow me to research within the realms of
trustrworthy AI goals that I hive in mind. With experience I have come to
lay a few groundrules when working with AI projects. One of the main thinsg I
believe in is the fact that AI  must not replace humans, rather assist or
enhance decision making. And that humans must be at the center of a
decision making loop. This position involves researching methodologies to
incorporate such ideas that are a part of the EU guidelines and I belive it
aligns with what I believe in. 

Moreoever, this position is in collaboration with the fintech companies (ING).
I belive that this is the right approach as a problem such as this cannot be
solved in isolation. The finance sector is critical as it affects both people
at the micro level and governments and global interactions at the macro level.
EU has already developed a generalised framework for trustworthy AI which is
one side of the picture. Applying to real wold scenarios and problems is a
whole new challenge. This PhD position requires developing and adapting these
guidelines for the FinTEch sector and I find that if I can even contribute a
bit to improving AI dependancy here, I would make a significant impact. 

The group AiForFintech itself caught my attention. I noticed that the three
principles of the AFR group - human centred, data driven and software
defined research is again what I believe in. The other tracks in the group are
all researching themes that we may be able to learn from when implementing the
pronciples of trustworthy AI. For eaxmple, advances in standardising CI/CD may
allow for greater accountability than in turn trickles down into our realm of
trustworthy AI. So overall, I believe that the group is laid out in a manner
that will enrich everyone's researh. 

Finally, I was also very inspired by the resarch you have recently conducted
into the reliability of music recommender systems in terms of how they predict
due to complexity of music descriptors and how they actually translate to what
humans periece from music. So I believe that I have a lot of learn from you in
terms of an exchange of ideas!

### Why TU Delft

Aside from the fact that TUDelf is a top university, I've always been impressed
by the active research in technology that takes place at this university. For
example, often when working on projects, I've always found a software package
or tool from TUDelft that has assisted me along the way. So to me, TUD is a
place of constant and cutting edge research. I also like the fact the the
unversity often collaborates with industry as it gives one a chance to assess
the impact of their work in the real world. This appeals to me as I feel I may
get a chance to share my research to actually help and not just be a repo on
Github. 

### What Do You Wish to Do After Your PhD?

I am interested in continuing as an independent researcher and entrepreneur. I
wish to:

1. Serve as an advisor in AI-based projects in developing countries that do not
   have a framework like the EU one, to encourage them to think of the
   significance of this problem and make it a part of their workflow from the
   get go.
2. I wish to work within the medical domain to assist in 3D bone fracture
   analysis. Medical domain is again a critical domain that cannot simply trust
   AI. I wish to chnage this relationship by providing my epertise gere. 


### Why would I be a good fit?
### What makes you a good candidate?

1. Experience in AI: I have experienec in implementig a large array of
   algorithms across various domains. So I have experience in the metholodogy
   and procedures. Moreover, I also have an understanding of the pitfalls or
   weaknesses in the AI pipelines. These sort of experiences will allow me to
   be comfortable in builing, handling existing AI solutions.
2. Background in mathematical economics: I can easily dove into the theory or
   mathematics behind the algorithms to try and understand why it may be
   behaving a certain way. My economics background allows me to assess the
   concepts stated in the EU guidelines. Thus by understanding the guidelines
   better, including it's challenges or weaknesses, I can better implememt them
   in the ML systems. Or I can bring about awareness around shortcomings.
3. Human-focused design: My experience in designing end-user focused tools will
   aloow me to focus on end user needs and thus design better tools.
4. Technical Skills: I have expereience in Python and its deep learning
   frameworks. I also have experiene managing big-data systems and I belive
   that as it is the fintech system, big data may be involved. 
5. Written Reports
6. Technical to non technical communication
7. Entrepreneural apprach


### What Challenges Do You Expect to Encounter?

1. No way to realise what the ground truth should be to compare results
   against.  Here we need to look outside of computer science.
2. How to truly establish what it means to be robust, what it means to maintain
   equality, fairness etc are hard to quantify and measure for success.
3. Data size and sensitivity of data means we need tools to be big-data. Also,
   dealing with sensitive information could be challengineg. Can we actually
   work with user data? Do we work closely with RCL (Risk, Compliance and
   Legistature teams)
4. What sort of metrics can we use to measure success? For example, in terms of
   predicting user investment products, we cant simply monitor their web/app
   usage as much of the relevant behaviour is conducted offline. 
5. End users will be a large heterogenous group of people. 
6. Lot at stake since banks need to be considered reliable. Any error may lead
   to significant loss of trust in the bank.
7. ING is a multinational bank so laws across countries differ,


### Strengths and Weaknesses

Strengths: I have a unique background in Social Science, Mathematics and
Computer Science. This allows me to look beyond projects as simply software
development, but more multidimensional. This has also worked in my favour as I
saw with say the OmniArt pariject. Here, we got to publlish our paper as I
tapped further into the social aspects of the topic. Again for the ICT4D
project, we refused to put out an AI-based voice system simply because we
addressed the project from a social perspective and found it completely
unsuitable. 


Weaknesses:

I find that I tend to go down rabbit holes that may take time away from the big
pictire research. Especially when it comes to researching new disciplines or
settup my a working environment in new systems.  For example, during my thesis
I got caught in the loop of tweaking parametes, or even when setting up systems
on foreign machines, I have faced bugs that I have relentlessly resolved that
were perhaps not necessary. I manage this research rabbit hole by maintaining a
written log of what I have done. This gives me concrete information on how much
time I have spent. I beive that as I continue to conduct further research, I
will be better at this.

### Time You Experienced a Setback?

Yes actually this occured with my thesis. I was very excited to implement a
state-of-the-art 3D PointCloud architecture. However, since my signals were
very low amidst a significant amount of background noise, I was unable to
achive good classification scores. I followed all the guidelines in the AI book
to tweak the model in various ways but to no success. This went on for about a
month. However, I decided to take a complete step back. I realised that I could
try to present the data in a completely different manner to highlight the
signals better. This approach worked and all of a sudden, my model performed
extremely well as I had expected it would. So it was a few months of uphill
battle. The lesson learnt here for me was not to fall into a rut of tweaking
and testing. Sometimes one needs to just step back and look at the starting
point even though it may seem scary. 


### Questions for Interviewee 
1. Can you tell me a bit more on what the role will involve? 
2. What is the nature of the data we wold work with? Is it simulated or real
   client data? If real client data, how are we proposing to work with this?
3. What is the state of research in terms of the EU guidelines? For example,
   transparency eg explanability is one of the guidelines. Do we know to what
   extent we need to enure this? Maybe more risk averse in terms of explability
   as it may impact consumers
4. What does the group aim to achieve in the short term?
5. Will there be opportunities to collaborate outside the group?
6. Is it encouraged to obtain conference funding, fellowship, awards etc for
   research?Can I get help with such matters?
7. WHat are the requirements to obtain a PhD? How many papers etc?
8. What is the workflow within the group? Weekly meetings etc?


# Randoms

[SUGGESTION] In the OmniART project, we used a two pronged approach - first, I
improved the algorithm itself by using field-specific and context specific
data. Second, we used an interactive UI to obtain additional information from
mreal-world users. We could have additionally improved our model by
incorporating these feedback into the system.
