<p><strong>Position:</strong> Trustworthy AI</p>

<h2 id="self-reflection">Self Reflection</h2>

<h3 id="tell-us-about-yourself">Tell Us About Yourself</h3>
    <p>I completed my undergraduate in Mathematical Economics in Canada. As
    part of the co-op program I also gained around 2 years of work experience,
    notably at Microsoft Canada where I served as an analyst for the finance
    and revenue team. This allowed me exposure to work within large,
    inter-disciplinary teams… For my final honours project, I undertook a 6
    month long project into modeling the spillover effects of restautant
    businesses into neighbourhood quality. The goal was to allow policy makers
    to target restaurant businesses when trying to improve neighbourhoods and
    attarct positive growth. This is the first instance where I noticed flaws
    in creating algorithms in a simulated environment versus testing with real
    world data. My work with simulated economics data showed that improving
    restaurant quality positively impacted neighbourhood quality. However, when
    I assessed my model on real world dataset, I noticed a negative if not null
    relationship. This is the first instance where I noticed that AI was not a
    perfect solution and infact a blackbox. This experience motivated me to
    further understand such algorithms and obtain more technical skills. That
    is why I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>My masters gave me several opportunities to develop technical skills in both
    SE and AI while working within inter-disciplinary environments.</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li><p>I conducted sentiment anaysis using state-of-the-art algorithm to
        obtain human sentiments from written comments on paintings. Here, I
        noticed shortcomings or dissonance between what the alorithm was
        supposed to do and what it actually derived from real world data. So in
        order to improve the system I had to tap into colour theory and human
        psychology to try and create my own framework to lead the model better.
        We used these results to develop an interactive analysis tool and this
        work got published in the ACMMM conference in 2019.</p></li> 
    <li><p>I also had the opportunity to work on an ICT4D project to aid
        sub-saharan farmers learn about weather conditions using a Voice-based
        application.  Here we wished to improve our application by using an AI
        driven prediction system. Here our prototypes failed miserabley since
        all major speech-to-text systems assume global accents and did not
        account for regional accents or language. So it often misinterpreted
        the responses and provided inaccurate information.</p></li> 
    <li><p>For my thesis, I was determined to build deep learning tools for
        inter-disciplinary research. So I collaborated with Physicists from
        Nikhef, the Netherlands eScience Center and UVA and developed an
        end-to-end 3D deep learning pipeline to detect neutrinos amidst
        significant background noise. In order to avoid some of the pitfalls of
        trustworthyness in deep learning, I used physics knowledge to drive the
        project (in terms of training data, evaluation metrics and visual
        analysis of results). My work is the first of its kind and sets the way
        for 3D deep learning in Particle Physics. I also built a regression 
        network to further obtain physics properties from the 3D pipeline.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Aside from the technical skills, I belive I gained skills relevant for
research in general. For example, I learnt to communicate technical information
to non-technical stakeholders through conducting a symposium for our OmniARt
project. I also served as project manager for the ICT4D course and communicated
with teams and officers in Ghana. For my thesis as well, I routinely shared and
discussed reults of my research with Physicists and other teams from
Nikhef.</p>
<p>Having completed my thesis, I realised that I was not satisfied with
stopping and I wished to learn more. Further, through my projects I belive I
had found a problem area to engage in - acknowledging and addressing the
reliability of AI in critical fields. Which is why I applied to this
position.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-you-want-to-do-a-phd">Why Do You Want To Do A PhD?</h3>
<p>The AI driven projects that I engaged in all demonstrated critical flaws in
the way we interact with and understand such algorithms. In the OmniArt project
I attempted to setup my own framework to address the reliabilityy of the AI.
But if there had been a well establised framework in place, I may have done a
better job in terms of my approach, my consistancy and my understanding. I
imagine facing this type of situation in a critical field say the medical
domain or the finance sector. The stakes rise considerably when lives or
finance or economies are involved. More and more systems are adopting AI but
not many are questioning it. I belive that this is a critical problem that I
personally faced throughout my academic life and I wish to address it through
further research.</p>
<p>From a more personal perspective, at each stage of my education, I have not
been satisfied with what I have learnt and wished to continue learning. Having
completed my Masters, I feel the same way. Moreover, I am not satisfied with my
contributions to science and society and believe that I can do more. I believe
that a PhD can help me fulfil these aspirations.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-you-apply-for-this-phd">Why Did You Apply for this PhD?</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>why the topic</li>
<li>why the group</li>
<li>past work they have done</li>
<li>university</li>
</ol>
<p>I belive that this position will allow me to research within the realms of
trustrworthy AI goals that I hive in mind. With experience I have come to lay a
few groundrules when working with AI projects. One of the main thinsg I believe
in is the fact that AI must not replace humans, rather assist or enhance
decision making. And that humans must be at the center of a decision making
loop. This position involves researching methodologies to incorporate such
ideas that are a part of the EU guidelines and I belive it aligns with what I
believe in.</p>
<p>Moreoever, this position is in collaboration with the fintech companies
(ING). I belive that this is the right approach as a problem such as this
cannot be solved in isolation. The finance sector is critical as it affects
both people at the micro level and governments and global interactions at the
macro level. EU has already developed a generalised framework for trustworthy
AI which is one side of the picture. Applying to real wold scenarios and
problems is a whole new challenge. This PhD position requires developing and
adapting these guidelines for the FinTEch sector and I find that if I can even
contribute a bit to improving AI dependancy here, I would make a significant
impact.</p>
<p>The group AiForFintech itself caught my attention. I noticed that the three
principles of the AFR group - human centred, data driven and software defined
research is again what I believe in. The other tracks in the group are all
researching themes that we may be able to learn from when implementing the
pronciples of trustworthy AI. For eaxmple, advances in standardising CI/CD may
allow for greater accountability than in turn trickles down into our realm of
trustworthy AI. So overall, I believe that the group is laid out in a manner
that will enrich everyone’s researh.</p>
<p>Finally, I was also very inspired by the resarch you have recently conducted
into the reliability of music recommender systems in terms of how they predict
due to complexity of music descriptors and how they actually translate to what
humans periece from music. So I believe that I have a lot of learn from you in
terms of an exchange of ideas!</p>

<h3 id="why-tu-delft">Why TU Delft</h3>
<p>Aside from the fact that TUDelf is a top university, I’ve always been
impressed by the active research in technology that takes place at this
university. For example, often when working on projects, I’ve always found a
software package or tool from TUDelft that has assisted me along the way. So to
me, TUD is a place of constant and cutting edge research. I also like the fact
the the unversity often collaborates with industry as it gives one a chance to
assess the impact of their work in the real world. This appeals to me as I feel
I may get a chance to share my research to actually help and not just be a repo
on Github.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-wish-to-do-after-your-phd">What Do You Wish to Do After Your PhD?</h3>
<p>I am interested in continuing as an independent researcher and entrepreneur.
I wish to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Serve as an advisor in AI-based projects in developing countries that do
    not have a framework like the EU one, to encourage them to think of the
    significance of this problem and make it a part of their workflow from the
get go.</li>
<li>I wish to work within the medical domain to assist in 3D bone fracture
    analysis. Medical domain is again a critical domain that cannot simply
    trust AI. I wish to chnage this relationship by providing my epertise
gere.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-would-i-be-a-good-fit">Why would I be a good fit?</h3>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-a-good-candidate">What makes you a good candidate?</h3>

<ol type="1">
<li>Experience in AI: I have experienec in implementig a large array of
    algorithms across various domains. So I have experience in the metholodogy
    and procedures. Moreover, I also have an understanding of the pitfalls or
    weaknesses in the AI pipelines. These sort of experiences will allow me to be
    comfortable in builing, handling existing AI solutions.</li>
<li>Background in mathematical economics: I can easily dove into the theory or
    mathematics behind the algorithms to try and understand why it may be
    behaving a certain way. My economics background allows me to assess the
    concepts stated in the EU guidelines. Thus by understanding the guidelines
    better, including it’s challenges or weaknesses, I can better implememt them in
    the ML systems. Or I can bring about awareness around shortcomings.</li>
<li>Human-focused design: My experience in designing end-user focused tools
    will aloow me to focus on end user needs and thus design better tools.</li>
<li>Technical Skills: I have expereience in Python and its deep learning
    frameworks. I also have experiene managing big-data systems and I belive
    that as it is the fintech system, big data may be involved.</li>
<li>Written Reports</li>
<li>Technical to non technical communication</li>
<li>Entrepreneural apprach</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-challenges-do-you-expect-to-encounter">What Challenges Do You Expect to Encounter?</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>No way to realise what the ground truth should be to compare results
    against. Here we need to look outside of computer science.</li>
<li>How to truly establish what it means to be robust, what it means to
    maintain equality, fairness etc are hard to quantify and measure for
    success.</li>
<li>Data size and sensitivity of data means we need tools to be big-data. Also,
    dealing with sensitive information could be challengineg. Can we actually
    work with user data? Do we work closely with RCL (Risk, Compliance and
    Legistature teams)</li>
<li>What sort of metrics can we use to measure success? For example, in terms
    of predicting user investment products, we cant simply monitor their
    web/app usage as much of the relevant behaviour is conducted offline.</li>
<li>End users will be a large heterogenous group of people.</li>
<li>Lot at stake since banks need to be considered reliable. Any error may lead
    to significant loss of trust in the bank.</li>
<li>ING is a multinational bank so laws across countries differ,</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="strengths-and-weaknesses">Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Strengths: I have a unique background in Social Science, Mathematics and
Computer Science. This allows me to look beyond projects as simply software
development, but more multidimensional. This has also worked in my favour as I
saw with say the OmniArt pariject. Here, we got to publlish our paper as I
tapped further into the social aspects of the topic. Again for the ICT4D
project, we refused to put out an AI-based voice system simply because we
addressed the project from a social perspective and found it completely
unsuitable.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I find that I tend to go down rabbit holes that may take time away from the
big pictire research. Especially when it comes to researching new disciplines
or settup my a working environment in new systems. For example, during my
thesis I got caught in the loop of tweaking parametes, or even when setting up
systems on foreign machines, I have faced bugs that I have relentlessly
resolved that were perhaps not necessary. I manage this research rabbit hole by
maintaining a written log of what I have done. This gives me concrete
information on how much time I have spent. I beive that as I continue to
conduct further research, I will be better at this.</p>

<h3 id="time-you-experienced-a-setback">Time You Experienced a Setback?</h3>
<p>Yes actually this occured with my thesis. I was very excited to implement a
state-of-the-art 3D PointCloud architecture. However, since my signals were
very low amidst a significant amount of background noise, I was unable to
achive good classification scores. I followed all the guidelines in the AI book
to tweak the model in various ways but to no success. This went on for about a
month. However, I decided to take a complete step back. I realised that I could
try to present the data in a completely different manner to highlight the
signals better. This approach worked and all of a sudden, my model performed
extremely well as I had expected it would. So it was a few months of uphill
battle. The lesson learnt here for me was not to fall into a rut of tweaking
and testing. Sometimes one needs to just step back and look at the starting
point even though it may seem scary.</p>

<h3 id="questions-for-interviewee">Questions for Interviewee</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li> [DONE] Can you tell me a bit more on what the role will involve?</li>

    client data? If real client data, how are we proposing to work with
    this?</li>

    transparency eg explanability is one of the guidelines. Do we know to what
    extent we need to enure this? Maybe more risk averse in terms of
    explability as it may impact consumers</li>
<li> What does the group aim to achieve in the short term?</li>

<h1 id="technical-questions">Technical Questions </h1>

<h2>Can You Suggest Some Ideas for Implementing the EU Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Human Oversight & Agency</h3>
<p>Make use of visual interfaces to allow humans to interact with system, at each
stage of the ML workflow.</p>

<h3>Technical Robustness & Safety </h3>
<p> Ensure no data leakage, data poisioning etc. Fallback to rule-based
approach in case of problems. </p>

<h3>Privacy & Governance</h3>

<p>GAN - use less data </p>
<p>Federated Learning - data never leaves the user </p>

<h3> Transparency </h3>
<p>
Documentation of decisions made, ensure explanability by ensuring that the
features it uses are explanable. 
</p>

<h3> Diversity, non-discrimination, fairness </h3>
<p>
This is the hardest to ensure, but should be in the data collection and
processing stage. For example, if a model has to predict how much loan a person
should get, should they be given personal details such as age, gender, race
etc? Should they be given address? Because the model can identify (potentially)
the race based on postcode.
</p>
<h1 id="randoms">Randoms</h1>
<p>[SUGGESTION] In the OmniART project, we used a two pronged approach - first,
I improved the algorithm itself by using field-specific and context specific
data. Second, we used an interactive UI to obtain additional information from
mreal-world users. We could have additionally improved our model by
incorporating these feedback into the system.</p>
<p> [TO PREP] Data Engineering Challenge </p>
<p> [TO THINK] Data availability when there is none. In this case, ING is
hesitant to share the data. So how can we research nevertheless? </p>
