# Part Time Assignment

**Position**: CWI Assistant

## Motivational Questions

1. Background
I completed my bachelors in Mathematical Ecnomics in Canada. Here I worked in
socio-economic projects.  At the time I believed  that the projects could
benefit from technical inputs. Which is why I came here to Amsterdam to pursue
a Masters in CS, at the VU and UVA with specialisation in Big Data Engineering.

Through my degree I was able to work on several large scale ML and DL projects.
For example I conducted sentiment analysis on written comments in the
Rijksmuseum. We used this information to develop an HCI centred, interactive
web interface. Our efforts led us to publish it as a demo paper at the ACMMM in
2019. More relevant to this project, our team developed personal and impersonal
models to predict and classify user activity. For my thesis, I was keen on
building deep learning tools to aid in inter-discliplinary research. So I
collaborated with Physicists from Nikhef, eScience Centre and UVA and built and
end to end 3D deep learning pipeline to detect neutrino particles amidst
significant background noise. My work is the first of its kind and so my
results obtained set the benchmark for subatomic Physics. 

Having completed my Masters, I noted shortcomings in AI namely it's lack of
focus on user centred algorithms and trustworthyness. This is what I wish to
reseearch moving forward. 

2. How will this project benefit you
I mentioned my interest in developing user focused and trustworthy AI.
The domain of affective computing driven by sensor data is one such domain
where a trustworthy and human centred system is essential. This project will
give me the experience that I can then extend to my future endevours.

From a technical perspective, I will get to work with signal data that can
often be complex, especially here given the end goal is to inform and
intervene.

Finally, since the project is in collaboration with industry, I believe that
any contribution I make may be able to positively impact end users.
