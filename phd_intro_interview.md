# PhD Interview Questions

**Position:** HCI

## Self Reflection

### Tell Us About Yourself

I completed my undergraduate in Mathematical Economics in Canada. Here, I also
gained around 2 years of work experience, notably at Microsoft Canada
This allowed me exposure to work within large, inter-disciplinary teams.
At the time, I worked on several social projects which were theoretically
driven and remained "textbook". I believed such projects could benefift from
 technical input. This is why, I came here to Amsterdam for a
Masters in CS at the UVA and the VU (with specialisation in Big Data
Engineering). 

My masters gave me several opportunities to develop technical skills in both SE
and AI while working within inter-disciplinary environments. 

1. I was introduced to the field of HCI first through a multimedia project with
   Marcel Worring where we developed a web-based tool for users to interact
   with and learn more about artwork in the Rijksmuseum. Our work led us to
   publish a demo paper at ACM 2019. 
2. After this, I also got the opportunity to lead a ICT4D project where we
   developed a voice-based weather reporting application for sub-saharan
   farmers. This project was a turning point for me because it showed me that
   all the advancements in intelligent AI systems came at the price of
   alienating subsets of populations. And there werent enough systems that
   actually truly considered end users - and diverse end users.
3. Most recently, I have been working at CWI in the DIS group under Abdo and
   Pablo. They introduced me to the wonderful field of Affective HCI. Here I
   led a 2 week long outdoor user study and carried it from initial collection
   of user data to finalied ML outcomes. As part of this study, we have
   authored a LBW at CHI 2022 this year and I am currently working on another
   paper. Given my interests in developing and understanding truly user-driven
   systems, I am independently writing a proposal to examine the impact of
   intelligent VUIs on end usre within the contexts of news delivery.
   Here, I am also collaborating with the ELSA lab - a collaboration effort on
   AI for media and democracy and have published a position paper questioning
   the ethics of VUIs for news delivery.

I am not satisfied with the work I've done do far. Moreover, my work so  showed
me a problem area to engage further in -
designing AI systems with an understanding of it's impact on users, especially
in terms of trustworthiness, and ethics within critical domains; and bridging
the gap between AI and underserved populations.  This is why I am now applying
for this PhD position. 


### Why Do You Want To Do A PhD?
The AI driven, intelligent systems projects that I engaged in all demonstrated
critical flaws in the way we design them - the voice-based application that we
designed based on user needs was never truly measured for impact on real users.
We should have analysed the experiences of sub-saharan farmers and used that to
drive our intelligent system. Not the other way around. Imagine the impact of a
technology driven system (rather than user driven) in critical domains such as
healthcare or education? This is a critial yet timely problem that needs to be
addressed. 

From a more personal perspective, at each stage of my education, I have not
been satisfied with what I have learnt and wished to continue learning. Having
completed my Masters, I feel the same way. Moreover, I am not satisfied with
my contributions to science and society and believe that I can do more. I
believe that a PhD can help me fulfil these aspirations. 


### Why Did You Apply for this PhD?
1. why the topic
2. why the group
3. past work they have done
4. university


### How can we collaborate - research ideas
1. interested in ubquitous affective sensing of indiviiduals vs a group to
   understand impact of hybrid learning spaces. 
2. Interested in collective impact on users
3. voice-based technology
4. considerations for an ICT4D + HCI project - deploying low cost sensors for
   remote learning, those with disabilities, global south. 

### Key ideas
1. pandemic forced us to epeience hybrid learning environments that are choc
   full of features yet many of us struggled to flourish. 


<!--I belive that this position will allow me to research within the realms of-->
<!--trustrworthy AI goals that I hive in mind. With experience I have come to-->
<!--lay a few groundrules when working with AI projects. One of the main thinsg I-->
<!--believe in is the fact that AI  must not replace humans, rather assist or-->
<!--enhance decision making. And that humans must be at the center of a-->
<!--decision making loop. This position involves researching methodologies to-->
<!--incorporate such ideas that are a part of the EU guidelines and I belive it-->
<!--aligns with what I believe in. -->

<!--Moreoever, this position is in collaboration with the fintech companies (ING).-->
<!--I belive that this is the right approach as a problem such as this cannot be-->
<!--solved in isolation. The finance sector is critical as it affects both people-->
<!--at the micro level and governments and global interactions at the macro level.-->
<!--EU has already developed a generalised framework for trustworthy AI which is-->
<!--one side of the picture. Applying to real wold scenarios and problems is a-->
<!--whole new challenge. This PhD position requires developing and adapting these-->
<!--guidelines for the FinTEch sector and I find that if I can even contribute a-->
<!--bit to improving AI dependancy here, I would make a significant impact. -->

<!--The group AiForFintech itself caught my attention. I noticed that the three-->
<!--principles of the AFR group - human centred, data driven and software-->
<!--defined research is again what I believe in. The other tracks in the group are-->
<!--all researching themes that we may be able to learn from when implementing the-->
<!--pronciples of trustworthy AI. For eaxmple, advances in standardising CI/CD may-->
<!--allow for greater accountability than in turn trickles down into our realm of-->
<!--trustworthy AI. So overall, I believe that the group is laid out in a manner-->
<!--that will enrich everyone's researh. -->

<!--Finally, I was also very inspired by the resarch you have recently conducted-->
<!--into the reliability of music recommender systems in terms of how they predict-->
<!--due to complexity of music descriptors and how they actually translate to what-->
<!--humans periece from music. So I believe that I have a lot of learn from you in-->
<!--terms of an exchange of ideas!-->

<!--### Why TU Delft-->

<!--Aside from the fact that TUDelf is a top university, I've always been impressed-->
<!--by the active research in technology that takes place at this university. For-->
<!--example, often when working on projects, I've always found a software package-->
<!--or tool from TUDelft that has assisted me along the way. So to me, TUD is a-->
<!--place of constant and cutting edge research. I also like the fact the the-->
<!--unversity often collaborates with industry as it gives one a chance to assess-->
<!--the impact of their work in the real world. This appeals to me as I feel I may-->
<!--get a chance to share my research to actually help and not just be a repo on-->
<!--Github. -->

<!--### What Do You Wish to Do After Your PhD?-->
<!--I am interested in continuing as an independent researcher and entrepreneur. I-->
<!--wish to:-->

<!--1. Serve as an advisor in AI-based projects in developing countries that do not-->
   <!--have a framework like the EU one, to encourage them to think of the-->
   <!--significance of this problem and make it a part of their workflow from the-->
   <!--get go.-->
<!--2. I wish to work within the medical domain to assist in 3D bone fracture-->
   <!--analysis. Medical domain is again a critical domain that cannot simply trust-->
   <!--AI. I wish to chnage this relationship by providing my epertise gere. -->


<!--### Why would I be a good fit?-->
<!--### What makes you a good candidate?-->

<!--1. Experience in AI: I have experienec in implementig a large array of-->
   <!--algorithms across various domains. So I have experience in the metholodogy-->
   <!--and procedures. Moreover, I also have an understanding of the pitfalls or-->
   <!--weaknesses in the AI pipelines. These sort of experiences will allow me to-->
   <!--be comfortable in builing, handling existing AI solutions.-->
<!--2. Background in mathematical economics: I can easily dove into the theory or-->
   <!--mathematics behind the algorithms to try and understand why it may be-->
   <!--behaving a certain way. My economics background allows me to assess the-->
   <!--concepts stated in the EU guidelines. Thus by understanding the guidelines-->
   <!--better, including it's challenges or weaknesses, I can better implememt them-->
   <!--in the ML systems. Or I can bring about awareness around shortcomings.-->
<!--3. Human-focused design: My experience in designing end-user focused tools will-->
   <!--aloow me to focus on end user needs and thus design better tools.-->
<!--4. Technical Skills: I have expereience in Python and its deep learning-->
   <!--frameworks. I also have experiene managing big-data systems and I belive-->
   <!--that as it is the fintech system, big data may be involved. -->
<!--5. Written Reports-->
<!--6. Technical to non technical communication-->
<!--7. Entrepreneural apprach-->


<!--### What Challenges Do You Expect to Encounter?-->

<!--1. No way to realise what the ground truth should be to compare results-->
   <!--against.  Here we need to look outside of computer science.-->
<!--2. How to truly establish what it means to be robust, what it means to maintain-->
   <!--equality, fairness etc are hard to quantify and measure for success.-->
<!--3. Data size and sensitivity of data means we need tools to be big-data. Also,-->
   <!--dealing with sensitive information could be challengineg. Can we actually-->
   <!--work with user data? Do we work closely with RCL (Risk, Compliance and-->
   <!--Legistature teams)-->
<!--4. What sort of metrics can we use to measure success? For example, in terms of-->
   <!--predicting user investment products, we cant simply monitor their web/app-->
   <!--usage as much of the relevant behaviour is conducted offline. -->
<!--5. End users will be a large heterogenous group of people. -->
<!--6. Lot at stake since banks need to be considered reliable. Any error may lead-->
   <!--to significant loss of trust in the bank.-->


<!--### Strengths and Weaknesses-->

<!--Strengths: I have a unique background in Social Science, Mathematics and-->
<!--Computer Science. This allows me to look beyond projects as simply software-->
<!--development, but more multidimensional. This has also worked in my favour as I-->
<!--saw with say the OmniArt pariject. Here, we got to publlish our paper as I-->
<!--tapped further into the social aspects of the topic. Again for the ICT4D-->
<!--project, we refused to put out an AI-based voice system simply because we-->
<!--addressed the project from a social perspective and found it completely-->
<!--unsuitable. -->


<!--Weaknesses:-->

<!--I find that I tend to go down rabbit holes that may take time away from the big-->
<!--pictire research. Especially when it comes to researching new disciplines or-->
<!--settup my a working environment in new systems.  For example, during my thesis-->
<!--I got caught in the loop of tweaking parametes, or even when setting up systems-->
<!--on foreign machines, I have faced bugs that I have relentlessly resolved that-->
<!--were perhaps not necessary. I manage this research rabbit hole by maintaining a-->
<!--written log of what I have done. This gives me concrete information on how much-->
<!--time I have spent. I beive that as I continue to conduct further research, I-->
<!--will be better at this.-->

<!--### Time You Experienced a Setback?-->

<!--Yes actually this occured with my thesis. I was very excited to implement a-->
<!--state-of-the-art 3D PointCloud architecture. However, since my signals were-->
<!--very low amidst a significant amount of background noise, I was unable to-->
<!--achive good classification scores. I followed all the guidelines in the AI book-->
<!--to tweak the model in various ways but to no success. This went on for about a-->
<!--month. However, I decided to take a complete step back. I realised that I could-->
<!--try to present the data in a completely different manner to highlight the-->
<!--signals better. This approach worked and all of a sudden, my model performed-->
<!--extremely well as I had expected it would. So it was a few months of uphill-->
<!--battle. The lesson learnt here for me was not to fall into a rut of tweaking-->
<!--and testing. Sometimes one needs to just step back and look at the starting-->
<!--point even though it may seem scary. -->


<!--### Questions for Interviewee -->
<!--1. Can you tell me a bit more on what the role will involve? -->
<!--2. What is the nature of the data we wold work with? Is it simulated or real-->
   <!--client data? If real client data, how are we proposing to work with this?-->
<!--3. What is the state of research in terms of the EU guidelines? For example,-->
   <!--transparency eg explanability is one of the guidelines. Do we know to what-->
   <!--extent we need to enure this? Maybe more risk averse in terms of explability-->
   <!--as it may impact consumers-->
<!--4. What does the group aim to achieve in the short term?-->
<!--5. Will there be opportunities to collaborate outside the group?-->
<!--7. What are the requirements to obtain a PhD? How many papers etc?-->
<!--8. What is the workflow within the group? Weekly meetings etc?-->
